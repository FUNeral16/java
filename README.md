Yo, I added the files for the triforce hw. I added them to a different folder so they wouldn't overwrite your files.

You forgot to add the source code from your computer. Instead, you uploaded the binary files. I can't read 1's and 0's, dawg. I'm not a computer.

Hopefully I can merge this with your repo. Still learning github so we'll see!
